# quilome

[Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil)-based hub application for driving multiple [monome](http://monome.org/) devices.

Motivation: hang the monomes off a Linux netbook, serving OSC and showing a simple graphical UI, so that the main audio/media machine doesn't have to spin up a JVM.

Deadline: [Music Tech Fest](http://www.musictechfest.org/), May 18/19.
